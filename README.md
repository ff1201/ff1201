<h2 align="left">Hi, I'm Fabio</h1>
<h3 align="left">I am a Statistics and Machine Learning PhD student on the <a href="https://statml.io">StatML programme.</h3>

My research focuses on high-dimensional statistics method development, with applications in genetics and finance:
 - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17094">Dual feature reduction for the sparse-group lasso and its adaptive variant (2024) </a>.
 - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15357">Strong screening rules for group-based SLOPE models (2024)</a>.
 - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09467"> Sparse-group SLOPE: adaptive bi-level selection with FDR-control (2023) </a>.

You can find my two R packages on my GitHub:
 - <a href="https://github.com/ff1201/dfr"> Repository for the dfr R package, which fits the sparse-group lasso using DFR </a>.
 - <a href="https://github.com/ff1201/sgs"> Repository for the sgs R package, which fits the sparse-group SLOPE and group SLOPE models </a>.
